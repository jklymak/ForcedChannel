# Channel Runs

## ChannelCoarse02

This run went out to about 107 y.  However N2 was quite a bit too small

## ChannelCoarse03

Start from 02 after last pickup.  Run w/ diffusivity and viscosity 10 times
higher.  Hope is stratification will go up.  Should be ^1/3.  So lets increase to 3e-4 to get some stratification down there...
